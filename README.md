# Build your own shell
This is a building exercise I conducted with the help of **codecrafters**. 

This is a shell made from scratch entirely in python. 
# Current Features
1. Standard output: Each command line starts with a symbol "$ " to represent its initiation.
   For now there exists the following commands:
   
      - exit
   
      - echo
   
      - type
   
      - pwd (print working directory)
   
      - cd (change directory)
   
   Any commands except result in an error.
   
3. Exit: To exit the shell.
4. Echo: Print back the arguments.
5. Type: Print the type of the argument.
6. Pwd: Print the current working directory, communicating directly with the os.
7. cd: Change the current directory.

# Purpose
A shell made with a High level language could be integrated with High level functionalities which we hope to achieve with this project.

Building a shell from scratch is a really good opportunity to learn how a computer actually runs software.
