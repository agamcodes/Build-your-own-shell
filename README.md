# Build your own shell
## This is a building exercise I conducted with the help of **codecrafters**. 

This is a shell made from scratch entirely in python. 
# Current Features
1. Standard output: Each command line starts with a symbol "$ " to represent its initiation.
   For now there exists the following commands:
      *exit
      *echo
      *type
      *pwd (print working directory)
      *cd (change directory)
   Any commands except result in an error.
2. Exit: To exit the shell.
3. Echo: Print back the arguments.
4. Type: Print the type of the argument.
5. Pwd: Print the current working directory, communicating directly with the os.
6. cd: Change the current directory.
